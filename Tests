The "tests" directory is dedicated to storing test scripts, test cases and any related assets for validating the fuctionality and performance of aerospace systems. Organising tests in a structures manner supports systematic testing, quality assurance systems.

Organising tests in a structured manner supports systematic testing , quality assurance and the identification of potential issues early in the development process.

Testing is a critical aspect of aerospace projects, ensuring the reliability, safety and performance of systems and components.

The "tests" directory serves as a centralised location for storing test scripts, test cases and associated assets, facilitating systematic testing processes thorughout the project lifecycle.

Organise the "tests" directory with subdirectories based on test types, system components or testing phases.

For instance, you might create subsirectories like "unit_tests", "integration_test" or outlining the expected outcomes and criteria for success.
