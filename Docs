The "docs" directory serves as the central hub for all project-related documentation.

This includes reports, design documents, user manuals and any other documentation critical for understanding and maintaining the aerospace projects.

By maintaining a structured documentation directory, team members can quickly access essential information, ensuring clarity and consistency across the project.

The "docs" directory is fundamental for preserving institutional knowledge and project history within the aerospace domain.

Documentation encompasses variuos aspacts, such as system architecture, design rationale, testing procedures and user guides.

In the aerospace industry, detailed documentation is essential due to stringent safety and compliance requirements.

Reports on project progress, test results and desgn decisions help stakeholders, including engineers, project managers and regulatory bodies, understand the project's evolution and its adherence to standards.

Maintaining an up-to-date and comprehensive "docs" directory ensures that knowledge is not siloed within individual team members but is shared across the entire aerospace project team.

It promotes collaboration, aids in troubleshooting and establishes a reliable reference for future development, ensuring the project's long-term success.
