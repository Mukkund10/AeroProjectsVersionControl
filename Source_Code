The "source_code" directory houses all source code related to the aerospace projects.

This includes software, firmware and any codebase relevant to the project.

Adoting a structured approached to organising source code facilitates version control, collaboration and seamless integration of changes into the overall project.

In the aerospace industry, source code is a critical component of the project, encompassing software applications, enbedded firmware and control algorithms.

The "source_code" directory plays a pivotal role in version control and collaboration among developers and engineers.

Organising source code into subdirectories based on software modules, subsystems or components can enhance maintainability and ease of navigation.

Consider creating subdirectories like "software" and "firmware" within "source_code" to distinguish between software applications running on ground systems and enbedded firmware running on aerospace platforms.

Each subdirectory may further contain subdirectiries for specific fuctionalities, modules or hardware components.

This hierarchical structure aids in maintaining a clear separation of concerns and allows for targeted development efforts.
