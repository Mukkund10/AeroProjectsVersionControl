The "data" directory is dedicated to storing datasets, test data and any other data-related assets used in the aerospace prjects.

Organsing data in a centralised location promotes consistency, reproducibility and efficient data management throughout the project lifecycle.

In aerospace projects, data plays a crucial role, raging from sensor readings and simulation outputs to experimental results and environmental data.

The "data" directory serves as a centralised repository for storing datasets and other data-related assets, ensuring accessibility and traceability for team members involved in analysis, testing and validation processes.

Organise the "data" directory with subdirectories based on data types, sources or project phase.

For example, you might create subsirectories like "sensor_data","simulation_results" or "test_data".

Each subdirectory can then contain datasets in thier respective formats, accompanised by metadata files or data sictionaries explaining the structure and context of the data.

Consider implementing version control for datasets, especially when modifications or updates are made.

Utilise Git LFS (large file storage) for efficiently handling large binary files commonly found in aerospace data.

This ensures that changes to datasets are tracked and historical verions can be referenced as needed.
